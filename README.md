# als-xeus-cling
An implementation of a cling kernel for jupyter-xeus. Heavily based on [xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling). The file "Display.iypnb" is a good example of what can be done with this kernel thanks to [als-basic-utilities](https://github.com/a-lain/als-basic-utilities).

## Dependencies:
- [als-basic-utilities](https://github.com/a-lain/als-basic-utilities)
- [xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus)
- [xeus-zmq](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-zmq)
- cling

## Installation:
- Linux: adapt the contents of the Makefile to match the configuration of your system.
- Windows: you are on your own.
